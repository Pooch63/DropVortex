      What are we doing here?
      We always update the best move with the best move OF THAT interation.
      As an example, say we're searching at depth 3, and red (the minimizing player) finds
      a play at index 23 that scores -100. We then search at depth 4, and red finds a play at
      index 20 that only scores -50. We'll still update the current best move as index 20.

      Why do we do this? Well, take our example. After searching at depth 4, red finds that
      the best play is index 20, which scores -50. If we then search at depth 5 and realize
      that playing at index 20 ACTUALLY yields a score of Infinity, red will OBVIOUSLY not want to
      play that, because that will lead to a win for blue. However, if we check whether or not we should
      update the best move, we would normally check if the current score is better than the last best score.
      -50 < INFINITY, so we would NOT update the best move and score. This means that by comparing the best move
      from seaches at depth n doesnn't account for realizing that best move is actually losing at a further depth.

      To compensate for that, we again update the best move with the best move of one SINGLE iteration.
      I.E., when we move on to depth 2, we will completely disregard the best move we found at depth 1.
      
      BUT, say the move in the first column is a losing move. If we go to depth, say, 7, and the search runs out
      of time after checking the FIRST move, we'll return that one even if we had a winning play. This is because,
      remember, we're using the best move from ONLY searches at depth 7.
      To fix this, after every search, we can update the move list to go from best to worst, based on the results from
      the previous search depth. In this way, we'll check the best possible moves first, so if we run out of time,
      there's a better chance we'll have already searched the winning move.
